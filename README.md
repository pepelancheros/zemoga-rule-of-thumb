### Missing parts
Due lack of time, there were some shores that I couldnt finish, here I am going to tell which parts were and how would I resolve them.

* Header on mobile:
With javaScript I would have shown the hamburguer icon adding a class and on scss I would put that class just on the querys for mobile. Also, I would do the same with the header content.

* changing thumbs icon inside image:
with an if() in javaScript check if the variable of the percentage of the positive votations is greater than 50%. If so, assign a class to the container with the icon and in that class put the icon and its styles.

* Is there anyone else... block: 
Export the image on photoshop and put the content in an absolute block similar as I did on the other images.
